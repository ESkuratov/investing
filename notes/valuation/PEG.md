# PEG Ratio

PEG Ratio= PE/EPS Growth

PE=Price/EPS [[PE]]

EPS Growth
EPS=The earnings per share


Assume the following data for two hypothetical companies, Company A and Company B:

Company A:
* Price per share = $46
* EPS this year = $2.09
* EPS last year = $1.74

Company B
* Price per share = $80
* EPS this year = $2.67
* EPS last year = $1.78

Given this information, the following data can be calculated for each company.

Company A
* P/E ratio = $46 / $2.09 = 22
* Earnings growth rate = ($2.09 / $1.74) - 1 = 20%
* PEG ratio = 22 / 20 = 1.1

Company B
* P/E ratio = $80 / $2.67 = 30
* Earnings growth rate = ($2.67 / $1.78) - 1 = 50%
* PEG ratio = 30 / 50 = 0.6
  

Many investors may look at Company A and find it more attractive since it has a lower P/E ratio between the two companies. But compared to Company B, it doesn't have a high enough growth rate to justify its P/E. Company B is trading at a discount to its growth rate and investors purchasing it are paying less per unit of earnings growth.
